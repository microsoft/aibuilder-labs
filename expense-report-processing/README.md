        > **Note:**
        > Setting a preferred solution ensures that all your custom components go into a dedicated unmanaged solution instead of the generic system solutions, giving you clear separation, consistent publisher settings, and full control.
        >
        > This makes it easy to export your tailored solution for deployment to other Dataverse environments and keeps collaboration with others clean and predictable.
